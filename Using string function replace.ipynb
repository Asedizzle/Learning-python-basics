       "\"  Introduction welcome to fundamentals of qualitative research methods my name is Leslie Currie I'm a senior research scientist at the Yale School of Public Health a co-director at the Robert Wood Johnson clinical Scholars Program at the Yale School of Medicine and a lecturer at Yale College and in all these various roles I have the opportunity to teach and mentor students in using qualitative research methods as well as collaborate across a number of multidisciplinary teams across the university I'd like to Series Overview give you an overview of the modules in this series and to start with the goal of the series is to enhance our capacity to conceptualize design and conduct qualitative research in the Health Sciences and by Health Sciences I mean clinical and health services research implementation science across a host of disciplines and specialties there are six modules in the series the first is what is qualitative research the second moves us to developing a qualitative research question which is actually not as easy as it might sound the third module addresses one of the major qualitative study designs the use of in-depth interviews the fourth module reviews a second major qualitative study design the use of focus groups the fifth module provides an overview of qualitative data analysis the principles and practices of analyzing qualitative data and the last module reviews the principles of scientific rigor in qualitative research and so to begin What is Qualitative Research with the first module what is qualitative research I want to invite you to take a moment to reflect on this fundamental premise really appreciating this assumption is necessary in order to maximize the use of qualitative methods in the Health Sciences so this is a quote attributed to Albert Einstein who reflected that not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted so if you pause and you think of a circumstance or an issue or a phenomenon in your own clinical practice or area of research I invite you to contemplate a phenomenon that perhaps can't have a number assigned to it if we're interested for instance in end-of-life care for terminally ill patients you might think about preferences for services at the end of life this may be something that it was very difficult to put a number on and so this assumption helps us appreciate the potential power of qualitative methods so as an example we Example Question 1 might be interested in the care of patients with epilepsy this first question is a quantitative question what proportion of people with epilepsy stop taking their medications for three consecutive days in a six-month period this is something that we can quantify put a number on it can be very important in an overall question and looking at adherence for meant to medication regimes in this patient group a different question related to the same phenomenon might be how does medication shape the lives of people with epilepsy and so looking at a very different perspective for the patient experience whether or not they feel mastery or self efficacy in trying to adhere to complex medication regimes so let's move to a Definition of Qualitative Research definition what is qualitative research there are many definitions this is one that we feel represents the critical elements of a qualitative research approach and so we'll work through this through this definition together for a minute qualitative research is a strategy for the systematic collection organization and interpretation of textual information so let's break this down into parts we use the word strategy to connote the fact that qualitative research question is thoughtful deliberate conceived of with a broader attention to context and to the relative strengths and limitations of a qualitative method so it's strategic in its nature it's systematic it's not something that's loose loosely formed ad hoc it rather relies on a set of established well-defined articulated methodologies for the collecting organizing and analyzing of qualitative data qualitative research broadly uses inductive approaches so working from the ground up to generate novel insights into phenomena that are difficult to measure quantitatively such as preferences for end-of-life care or issues of self-efficacy and mastery in self-care management so qualitative Qualitative Methods methods can do a couple of things two broad buckets the first being generating a comprehensive description of processes mechanisms or settings so thinking about processes of implementing clinical care mechanisms how one intervention may achieve a particular outcome or settings what is it like to care for patients and their families in a particular environment these methods can also characterize participant perspectives and their experiences in great depth here we might think about individual health behaviors individual experiences of care in a particular clinic setting so want to spend a few minutes on this figure here in this Venn diagram we see on one in one circle qualitative in the other circle quantitative we have arrows pointing to the center of the intersection of these circles in order to convey the really I think very critical notion that quantitative and qualitative methods really exist along a continuum of measurement that each has its respective strengths and limitations and that when we draw upon those two in order to minimize the limitations in a particular method and maximize its assets we use mix we can use mixed methods which is the combining of qualitative and quantitative methods so let's just populate one of these circles on the qualitative methods circle so I mentioned qualitative methods in terms of approach is inductive in nature so we're not coming to a research question with any a priori hypotheses that we're testing we're rather working from the ground up qualitative research in terms of its goal is to achieve depth of understanding so we're looking in a very deep way to unpack critical facets of a given phenomenon we may be interested in generating a hypotheses that can then go on and be tested in a quantitative study qualitative work occurs in a natural setting it's not experimental it's not controlled it doesn't happen in a lab rather we're often interested in features of the natural environment that may help us understand the question of interest sampling approaches and qualitative methods are purposeful in nature so just take a moment here to think together about what purposeful means this is in contrast to random sampling so rather than for instance were in an emergency department setting and we are rather than recruit every fifth patient who comes through the doors of the emergency department a purposeful sampling design would choose individual patients who come through the door that share a given characteristic so for instance if we're interested in the care of patients who are homeless in the emergency department setting we'd want to be very purposeful in that design and choosing only those who have the experience that we're interested in studying data collection in qualitative methods is done through interview guides and various kinds of observation tools these are much more open-ended than structured surveys or instrumentation we use in our quantitative studies and lastly data analysis is iterative it's a process of interpreting data going out to the field collecting data interpreting that going back out to the field collecting day and interpreting that this is in contrast to our approaches in for instance a structured survey on quantitative methods where we collect all of the data and then begin our analysis only at that point and so you can see how the quality principles of qualitative methods line up with a quantitative methods and I think very important to consider that these are simply a range of tools all designed to measure different aspects of phenomena of interest so what are the products of Qualitative Research Products qualitative research what can we make of this well there are four at least four ways to think about what we generate through qualitative methods the first product is recurrent themes or hypotheses we're going to look at an example of that in a moment the second kind of product might be a survey instrument measure so using a qualitative exploratory phase in order to design a survey to measure something that hasn't been measured previously taxonomy these are classification systems in order to identify essential properties of a particular construct and conceptual models or theories these are frameworks for helping us understand a particular phenomenon these are four major products of qualitative research the most common we see in the health sciences are recurrent themes or hypotheses so themes are unifying concepts or statements and they can do a couple of things the first is to help us identify and characterize a number of aspects of health care and health the first can be patterns of behaviors we might look at how patterns recur in a certain patient population or in a certain environment they can help us understand group interactions and individual perceptions themes also can help us develop testable hypotheses they can do this by helping identify the salient factors what matters in a given to a given question what matters say from a patient's perspective and they can help inform predictions about relationships how to specs or dimensions of a given question might relate to one another so it's good let's look at an example Example this is a paper written by a former clinical scholar at the Robert Wood Johnson program Lisa diamond and Lisa was very interested in the use of interpreters by resident physician physicians in caring for patients who have limited English proficiency and so Lisa conducted a qualitative study she interviewed residents at two academic medical centers with excellent interpreter services on site and she talked with the residents to understand their experience in using interpreters in these environments in order to care for these for these patients this is an excerpt from the published paper which is in the Journal of general internal medicine and this is to give you an example of what a fee Matic output looks like this theme is in is in bold this is one of the five recurrent themes in the paper and the primary theme here the emphasis is to indicate that residents physicians recognize that they under use professional interpreters and describe this phenomenon as quote getting by sometimes we use the language of participants in order to represent the key element the most pertinent essence of a given theme and then what follows is several sentences that describe that theme in greater depth and then followed by an illustrative quote so using the words of participants in order to support and illustrate the higher-level theme and just to read this together this theme this quote from a resident said that I know that when people are very pushed for time they may or may not call an interpreter they may just get by on the few words they know in different languages for like pain and take a deep breath and just fumble through you probably get a pretty bad history and not maybe a great and maybe not a great physical exam either it's an example of thematic output so let's conclude with a Conclusion few thoughts first qualitative method can provide unique contributions to health services and clinical research we've talked through briefly some examples in this introductory segment second there are rigorous and widely accepted procedures for study design sampling data collection and data analysis and qualitative research and in the remaining five modules in this series we'll talk more about primary methodologies interviews and focus groups and data analysis in that context thank you   \""
